                    Over the summer of 2023, I had the enriching opportunity to work with Lake Forest College, where I delved into the realm of SQL Server Management Studio. My primary focus was on crafting tailored queries to generate athlete data for the Athletics Department. This hands-on experience not only deepened my understanding of database management but also honed my analytical skills as I uncovered insights crucial for decision-making in creating complex queries. Additionally, I gained valuable exposure to Jenzabar, a robust student information system widely used in higher education. 
                    <br><br>
                    During this semester, I collaborated with my research partner to integrate their AI model into Jenzabar using Constituo at Lake Forest College. This involved navigating the intricacies of both the AI model and the college's information system to ensure seamless integration. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience, as we worked to leverage a complex technology to enhance the capabilities of the existing infrastructure. This project not only expanded my technical skills but also provided valuable insights into the practical applications of AI in educational settings.  <br><br>

                    Python has been my go-to coding language throughout my journey at Lake Forest College. From diving into data analytics projects to crafting fundamental coding exercises like a calculator, Python has been my trusty companion. Its versatility and ease of use have allowed me to explore various facets of programming, from manipulating data sets to building simple yet functional applications. Through countless hours of practice and experimentation, Python has become not just a tool, but an integral part of my problem-solving toolkit. As I continue to delve deeper into the realms of computer science, I'm excited to see where Python will take me next.

                    In my sophomore year of college, I embarked on an exciting project: building an 'I Spy' game using Java. While Java isn't my primary coding language, the challenge presented a fantastic opportunity to expand my programming horizons. Crafting this game required meticulous attention to detail and creative problem-solving skills. (Buttons and Action Event listeners weren't the greatest thing to master here :) )<br><br> Despite Java not being my go-to language, I found that my strong foundation in programming principles allowed me to adapt quickly and effectively. This experience underscored the importance of versatility and adaptability in the ever-evolving field of computer science. While Java may not be my common tool, it's reassuring to know that I have a solid foundation in a variety of programming languages.
